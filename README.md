An educational 2D game developed by the team GO GIRLS! for a school competition, combining adventure and learning through a pirate-themed interactive experience.

About the Game

Pirații din Karaibe is an educational adventure game where players take on the role of pirates navigating between islands to test and improve their knowledge across multiple school subjects.
The game features two difficulty levels—Beginner and Advanced—each consisting of seven islands that must be completed in order. Every island represents a different subject: Art, Psychology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, and History.
On each island, players must answer 3–4 questions, earning a specific amount of points and in-game currency per correct answer. Pirates can revisit already completed islands to earn money again using a different, randomly selected set of questions, which can be used to repair the ship or buy food.
While traveling, players may encounter dangerous obstacles such as changing weather conditions, sharks, enemy pirates, or aggressive birds, all of which can damage the ship. Progression is linear: players cannot move to the next island without completing the previous one.

Objectives and Educational Value

The main objective of the game is to help players understand theoretical concepts from each subject through animations and interactive challenges. Additionally, the game encourages strategic thinking by requiring players to manage resources such as food and ship condition.
Each food item provides a limited saturation time; if the pirate does not eat again before this time expires, the level is considered lost and the player’s progress is reset, adding an element of survival and responsibility to the learning process.
This project combines education, strategy, and adventure, offering an engaging way to learn while reinforcing discipline, decision-making, and subject comprehension.
